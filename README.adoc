== Work time calculator

An interactive CLI tool to calculate work time.

This is a highly opinionated CLI tool I built for my specific needs.
In time, I will probable make it more generic and configurable.
For now, the following assumptions are made.

* You have an unpaid 30 minute lunch break

=== TODO

* [ ] Configuration file for default settings and altering behaviour in interactive mode
* [ ] Non-interactive mode with CLI arguments parsing
